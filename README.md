# Clean Quest

Turn chores into a game: reward your kids with XP or cash.

## Stack

React app scaffolded with Vite and Vitest. Uses PocketBase as the backend (required).

- React (latest)
- Vite (latest)
- Vitest + Testing Library (JSDOM)

## Scripts

- `npm install` — install deps
- `npm run dev` — start dev server
- `npm run build` — production build
- `npm run preview` — preview build
- `npm test` — run tests in watch mode
- `npm run test:run` — run tests once
- `npm run test:coverage` — coverage report

## PocketBase backend

The gameplay UI (Task Board + HUD) talks to PocketBase via REST when `VITE_POCKETDB_URL` is set. Use the PocketBase admin GUI to manage data (collections are provisioned by the included migration).

Before adding tasks in the app, create at least:
- One Quest (collection: `quests`)
- One Task Type (collection: `task_types`)

Then, in the app’s Task Board, pick the Quest and Task Type and add tasks. Completion updates sync to PocketBase.

Environment variables (`.env` at project root):

```
VITE_POCKETDB_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8090
```

## Business rules

- Task value fallback: when a task `finalValue` (or `value`) is missing or equal to 0, the UI uses its associated task type `defaultValue` for display and for the Estimated Money total.
- Rules fallback: when the current quest has an empty `rules` field, the UI looks back through previous quests (sorted by start date descending) and shows the first non‑empty `rules` it finds. If none exist, it displays “No rules yet.”

### Units for task values

- The `quests` collection has a new optional `unit` text field that defines the unit used to display task values in the UI (in the task list and in the Estimated Money panel).
- Supported values: `€`, `$`, or `XP`.
- Default is `XP` (points) when the field is empty.
- Rendering:
  - For currencies (`€`, `$`), the symbol prefixes the number (e.g., `€ 12`).
  - For other units (e.g., `XP`), the unit is suffixed (e.g., `12 XP`).

## Docker (PocketBase)

A production multi-stage Dockerfile is included at `Dockerfile` (based on PocketBase docs). It builds the React app with Vite (optionally runs Vitest) and embeds the static files into `/pb/pb_public` inside the PocketBase image.

Build the image (override `PB_VERSION`/`PB_ARCH` if needed):

```
docker build -t clean-quest-pocketbase \
  --build-arg PB_VERSION=0.22.14 \
  --build-arg PB_ARCH=linux_amd64 .
```

Run it, persisting data to `./pb_data` and exposing port 8090:

```
mkdir -p pb_data
docker run --name pocketbase -p 8090:8090 \
  -v "$(pwd)/pb_data:/pb/pb_data" \
  -d clean-quest-pocketbase
```

Point the React app to it by setting in `.env`:

```
VITE_POCKETDB_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8090
```

Then run the frontend dev server:

```
npm run dev
```

Notes:
- `PB_ARCH` values: `linux_amd64` (x86_64), `linux_arm64` (Apple Silicon/ARM).
- The container exposes `/pb/pb_data` as a volume for persistence.
- Healthcheck hits `/api/health` on port 8090.
- The built SPA is served from `/pb/pb_public`. No separate web server is required.

### docker-compose

`docker-compose.yml` is included to run PocketBase and (optionally) a Vite dev server.

- Build and run PocketBase (production image with embedded SPA):

```
docker compose up -d pocketbase
```

- Run Vite dev server alongside PocketBase (hot reload):

```
docker compose --profile dev up web-dev pocketbase
```

You can configure build arguments and Vite envs via a local `.env` file (see `.env.example`). Common variables:

- `PB_VERSION`, `PB_ARCH` — PocketBase binary
- `VITE_POCKETDB_URL` — PocketBase URL the frontend uses
- `VITE_BASE` — Vite base path (defaults to `/`)
- `SKIP_TESTS` — set to `true` to skip Vitest during Docker build
- `UID`, `GID` — host user/group IDs used by services (fixes bind-mount permissions)

If you see PocketBase errors like "permission denied" or "unable to open database file", ensure the bind-mounted data directory is writable by the container user. Either set `UID`/`GID` in `.env` to match your host user, or run:

```
mkdir -p pb_data
sudo chown -R $(id -u):$(id -g) pb_data
```

### Migrations (PocketBase)

PocketBase migration scripts live in `pb_migrations/` and are copied into the image at `/pb/pb_migrations`.

- Apply migrations manually:

```
docker compose run --rm pocketbase migrate up
```

- Rollback last migration:

```
docker compose run --rm pocketbase migrate down
```
